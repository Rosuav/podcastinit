### Interview
- Please introduce yourself
- How did you get introduced to Python?
	- Learned about it from Co-Founder Alex
- For anyone not familiar with CheckIO, can you explain what it is? - Tobias
- What was the inspiration for creating the CheckIO platform? - Tobias
	- Alex was bored working in a bank and wanted to create a place for sharing practice problems
	- What is your goal with this platform? - Tobias
		- Become global community for most popular coding languages
		- Remain open and supportive
- How do you deal with the question of ownership and licensing in CheckIO? Was this a tricky hurdle to get past in the site's creation? -Chris
	- Being willing to share solutions publicly is a core part of the site.
		- This had to be more explicitly stated due to some users confusion early on.
- Growing a community is difficult because of the chicken and egg problem. How did you kickstart the growth of the CheckIO community? - Tobias
	- Community always number one priority
	- Started organically
	- Initially had 24/7 live chat to help new users
	- Openness was attractive, led to critical mass
	- As community grew, need for live chat decreased
	- Nature of Python community lends itself well to a collaborative, open community
	- Guido provided advice on how to grow and foster community
- Guido himself has participated in a number of conversations on your platform to critique submissions. Have you received any feedback from him directly about his impressions of the system? - Tobias
- How does diversity play into CheckIO? Are there aspects of the site's design that are purposefully meant to attract a diverse audience? -Chris
	- CheckIO has always targeted people with basic coding experience
	- Early live chat feedback focused around very new coders wishing there was more material for them
	- These early challenges resulted in the development of [Empire of Code](https://empireofcode.com/)
- There are a number of other online programming-oriented games available. What makes CheckIO and Empire of Code stand out from them? - Tobias
	- Priority of community
	- Others are more about gaming, showcasing talent
- How did you design the gamification aspects of CheckIO, and how important do you think they are to the site's success? -Chris
	- CheckIO was never a game, more of a library of challenges that have game elements
	- Empire of Code is all about gamification, code and algo improvement are baked into the gameplay
		- You choose Python or Javascript "legions" at character creation time, this is a one time choice.
		- Buildings, troop movements, materials, etc. are all based in code
		- Players can steal code and algorithms from other players
			- Incredible innovation
		- Great adoption story for new users - can start playing without writing any code
			- But in order to really excel you will WANT to start writing code
			- So many people have their original motivations for coding come from playing games
		- Cooperative play in the form of training missions with other players
			- This is an opportunity to learn how people on the other side are solving the same problem
		- New languages are planned - Ruby, maybe Java?
- Do you think that there is something about the Python language or community that inspires adoption of this kind of gamified practice? - Tobias
- You recently released the beta of a new experience called Empire of Code which is more akin to the type of video game that many people are familiar with. What inspired that evolution? - Tobias
	- As part of the new experience, you also added JavaScript as an available language. Do you intend to add new languages in the future? - Tobias
	- Is there a particular demographic or set of demographics that you are targeting with Empire of Code vs CheckIO? - Tobias
- What's the monetization strategy for Empire of Code or CheckIO? - Tobias
	- For Empire, you can play for free but you might keep losing your resources until you can learn to code more effectively, OR you can buy a shield which will protect your resources for a time.
- In CheckIO, how do you label the difficulty level of the individual puzzles, is there a set of guidelines for that or is it up to the puzzle writer / submitter? -Chris
	- CheckIO trusts its community
		- The community rates each challenge
- Part of the CheckIO platform is the ability for users to submit their own problems. How much vetting is involved before these submissions are available to users of the site? - Tobias
- Where do you see CheckIO and Empire of Code going in the future? - Tobias
	- Want to have Empire of Code known as the best online game that blends in programming by the end of 2016
	- In ~5 years want to see people saying the CheckIO/Empire of Code inspired people to program as a career
	- In ~10 years want to see all major languages represented
	- Aiming to become a major game publisher
