We just added the ability to donate to the show and we wanted to explain our plans for how to use those donations. We are making this podcast because we love Python and its community, not because we want to make money off of it. In light of that you may be asking "Then why are you asking for donations?", which is a valid question. We will use the money from your donations to cover our operating costs, which include hosting costs for the episodes and RSS feed, as well as the server on which we run this site. Any money that is left over after covering these expenses will be donated to the PSF (Python Software Foundation), so that they can continue to do grow and support the Python ecosystem. For more information on the PSF you can visit their [website](https://www.python.org/psf/).

You can find links to donate to us on the right side bar. We accept donations via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/podcastinit), [Flattr](https://flattr.com/profile/podcastinit), [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/Podcast__init__/) and [PayPayl](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=ZqkL8LrlFbzURzW779hyQ3v8TpyW5-Ggn9B8ukQslH6-7XfgdoLy539RJua&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d96f000117187ac9edec8a65b311f447e) so that you can give in whatever manner is most convenient for you. As always, we appreciate your support and for taking the time out of your day to listen to us. If you like what we're doing we would love to hear about it. If you don't like what we're doing, we would like to find out why and what we can do to improve.
