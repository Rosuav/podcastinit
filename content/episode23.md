### Interview with Hylang Developers
* Introductions
* How did you get introduced to Python? - Chris
* Before we get too far along can you explain what Hy is? - Tobias
* What inspired you to create Hy? - Chris
* Name is short for Hymenoptera
* What do you recommend as reference material for Python developers to gain familiarity with idiomatic Lisp? - Tobias
* What are some of the problem domains where implementation becomes easier or more elegant as a result of Hy's LISP syntax? - Chris
* Given the ability to create powerful macros in Lisp, could Hy be used as a way of prototyping or backporting new language features in Python? - Tobias
* What are some of the most challenging and interesting problems you encountered bringing an alternate syntax to the Python runtime? - Chris
* While playing around with the Hy REPL I noticed that it does visual matching of parentheses when closing an expression. What other niceties have been included in the REPL? - Tobias
* What are your thoughts on adding autocompletion to the REPL as a way of encouraging discovery and exploration of the Hy language? - Tobias
* Which LISP variant is Hy most similar to, and why? - Chris
* How does garbage collection work in Hy, and why? - Chris
* How hard would it be to port existing LISP packages to Hy like MACSYMA or CLOS? - Chris
* What kind of overhead in terms of runtime performance and memory usage does Hy impose? Has this been a challenge in Hy's development? - Chris
* What are some of the most innovative uses for Hy that you have seen or created? - Tobias
* What does the future hold for Hy? - Tobias
* I noticed that there are a large number of core contributors to Hylang and I'm curious how you determine what features to work on? - Tobias
