- We are recording today on Aug 18th, 2015 and your hosts as usual are Tobias Macey and Chris Patti
- Today we are interviewing Bryan Van de Ven about the Bokeh project

### Interview with Bryan Van de Ven
- Introductions
- How did you get introduced to Python? - Chris
- For our listeners who aren't familiar with what Bokeh is, can you describe it? - Tobias
- What inspired you to create Bokeh? - Chris
- Bokeh has integrations with some of the other Python graphing libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn. I can see how this would be useful to easily update existing code to publish visualizations on the web. Are there other use cases for these integrations? - Tobias
- I noticed that Bokeh has bindings for some languages other than Python. R and Julia are obvious candidates due to their strong focus on analytics work, I'm curious what made you choose Scala and Lua as languages worth targeting? - Tobias
- Do you lose any capabilities using the javascript library by itself? - Tobias
- Other than the sample data sets that come with Bokeh, can you suggest a good publicly available data set with accompanying tutorial for people who want to get started with data visualization using Bokeh? - Chris
- Can you provide some comparisons between D3.js and the Bokeh javascript library in terms of capabilities and performance? - Tobias
- The Bokeh project has a server component that allows for streaming data to clients. Can you describe the architecture of that and some example uses for it? - Tobias
- Why was the server written as a Flask blueprint as opposed to making it a component of another framework such as Django or Pyramid and how difficult would it be to port the functionality to another system? - Tobias
- What's the most interesting use of Bokeh you've seen? - Chris
- Are you aware of any projects in other languages that are comparable to Bokeh? - Tobias
