##Work
How cool is it that we get to play with computers and get PAID for it? I've been messing with technology since I stood in front of my Mattel Intellivision in 1979 and wished that
*I* could control the objects moving around the screen (Yes, I'm that old :).

I'm happiest when I'm working in a dynamic language like Python or Ruby, and spend most of my time doing infrastructure s code work in Chef and Python for my employer,
a fine purveyor of online backup solutions.

##Play
* I spend as much time as I possibly can with my lovely wife, often taking advantage of the incredible culture and cuisine the Boston areas has to offer.
* I'm a proud Freemason and enjoy spending time with my brothers of [Amicable Lodge](http://www.amicablelodge.com)
* I love to read, especially escapist flights of urban fantasy or science fiction with the occasional bit of non fiction thrown in to keep me honest.
* I also love playing games of all kinds, but especially board games with friends and the occasional video game, especially indie games.
