I taught myself Python shortly after learning to program in college and have been using it everywhere I can since then. I have worked primarily in backend software development and systems engineering with forays into front-end JavaScript applications and Android development. My favorite tools for the job include [SaltStack](http://saltstack.com) for systems and infrastructure automation and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) for flexible web application development. I also enjoy experimenting with other programming languages and learning about distributed systems.

When I'm not working, I like to spend time with my family, read, hike and watch movies. My favorite topics to read about are technology (surprise!), science fiction (Heinlein is pretty great) and fantasy. You can follow me on Twitter [@TobiasMacey](https://twitter.com/TobiasMacey), read my ramblings as [The Renaissance Dev](http://renaissancedev.com), hire me for consulting at [Boundless Notions](http://boundlessnotions.com) or see my work history on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/tmacey).

###Work
How cool is it that we get to play with computers and get PAID for it? I've been messing with technology since I stood in front of my Mattel Intellivision in 1979 and wished that
*I* could control the objects moving around the screen (Yes, I'm that old :).

I'm happiest when I'm working in a dynamic language like Python or Ruby, and spend most of my time doing infrastructure s code work in Chef and Python for my employer,
a fine purveyor of online backup solutions.

###Play
* I spend as much time as I possibly can with my lovely wife, often taking advantage of the incredible culture and cuisine the Boston areas has to offer.
* I'm a proud Freemason and enjoy spending time with my brothers of [Amicable Lodge](http://www.amicablelodge.com)
* I love to read, especially escapist flights of urban fantasy or science fiction with the occasional bit of non fiction thrown in to keep me honest.
* I also love playing games of all kinds, but especially board games with friends and the occasional video game, especially indie games.
