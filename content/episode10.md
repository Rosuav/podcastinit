### Interview with Brian Granger and Fernando Perez

*  Introductions

*  How did you get introduced to Python? - Chris

*  For anyone who may not have heard of or used IPython, can you describe what it is? -Tobias

*  How challenging was it to port IPython to Python 3? - Chris

    *  Thomas Kluyver

*  What prompted the name change from IPython to Project Jupyter and were there any associated changes in the project itself? - Tobias

    *  Name inspired by Julia, Python and R - the three programming languages of data science

*  Data scientists have adopted the use of IPython notebooks in their work on a large scale, what is it about notebooks that lend themselves to this particular problem domain? - Chris

    *  Bayesian methods for Hackers - Cameron Davidson-Pilon

    *  Signal processing in Python

    *  O'Reilly added support for notebooks into Atlas publishing platform

*  IPython Notebook seems like an incredible tool for educators is advanced fields. Have you seen wide spread adoption in this area and is it a focus for the project? - Tobias

    *  NBGrader - notebook grader

*  Github recently added the ability to [render notebooks in a repo](http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/05/07/rendering-notebooks-on-github/). Did you work with them to build that integration? - Chris

*  What are some of the most interesting uses of IPython notebooks that you have seen? - Tobias

    *  Gallery of interesting notebooks on the wiki

    *  Reproducible academic publications

        *  Couple of dozen scientific papers, some very high profile

    *  Educational notebooks on various subjects

    *  Great learning resource, as well as entertaining

    *  MOOC taught between distributed team on Open EdX using IPython notebooks about numerical computing with Python

    *  Peter Norvig collection of IPython notebooks

        *  Includes analysis of traveling salesman problem

    *  notebooks.cogneuro.org - time series data analysis

*  Are there any notable projects that use IPython as one of their components? - Chris

    *  KBase for computational biology

    *  Sage - Open source mathematics project written in Python

        *  Created by number theorist William Stein

* Custom parser to allow for non-python syntax

* Quantopian - Collaborative platform for financial modeling. Runs on top of IPython

* Wakari from Continuum Analytics - hosted IPython with computing environment

    *  Rackspace hosts TempNB and other IPython services

* Where do you see Project Jupyter going in the future? Are there any particular new features you'd like to see added? - Tobias

    *  One of the biggest targeted features is real-time collaboration

        *  Prototyped by engineers from Google

    *  More modular UI and architecture

    *  Multi-user deployments with Jupyter Hub

* A few weeks ago we interviewed Jonathan Slenders who wrote ptpython, which brings IDE like capabilities to interactive Python. Have you ever considered including this in IPython? - Chris

* What are some of the features that an average user might not know about? - Tobias

* Is there anything in particular that you would like to ask our listeners for help with? - Chris

    *  Pitch in with the development effort

    *  Organize community events on behalf of IPython/Jupyter

    *  Be patient while documentation improves :)
