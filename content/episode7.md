###Interview with Jacob Kaplan-Moss
*  Introductions
*  How were you first introduced to Python?
*  So, we wanted to invite you on the show to discuss the keynote that you gave at this years PyCon. Can you tell us what you mean when you say that you're a mediocre programmer and why that is such an important admission to make?
*  What are some ways that we can change the tone of the conversation around programming skill?
*  What do we gain by admitting to ourselves and others that we are not all phenomenal engineers?
*  Where does the myth of exceptional vs terrible programmers come from? Can you provide some examples of times that you came in contact with this narrative?
*  How do you think hiring tactics in technology companies contribute to this misconception and how can they be more accepting of average programmers?
*  What are some ways that we can work toward eradicating the myth of the 10x programmer?
*  Thinking about our industry's problems retaining women and other undervalued groups, do you think the way many managers do performance reviews play a role? If so, how can we do better?

* Can you tell us about some other ongoing narratives in the technology industry that you find equally as damaging as our misconceptions around skills and knowledge? - Tobias
